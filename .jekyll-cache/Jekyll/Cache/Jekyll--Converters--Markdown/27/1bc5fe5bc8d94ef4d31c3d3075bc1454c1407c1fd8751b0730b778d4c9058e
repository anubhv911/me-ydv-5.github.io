I"<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> I am more than happy to announce that Iâ€™ve been able to upload the images on to the wiki server!! The problem was not in <code class="highlighter-rouge">form_data_post</code> but in <a href="https://bitbucket.org/me_ydv_5/octave/src/59d3d9c4af257ca141e60420e9ba3c8ab32af0af/liboctave/util/url-transfer.cc#lines-663"><code class="highlighter-rouge">http_post</code></a> (in my version of Octaveâ€™s repository). There were two faults:</p>

<ul>
  <li>I was calling <code class="highlighter-rouge">http_action</code> which then used to call <code class="highlighter-rouge">http_post</code> inturn which then POSTed the data, despite the fact that there was no <code class="highlighter-rouge">POSTFIELD</code> or POSTable data with me, it was <code class="highlighter-rouge">FORM</code> submission instead. Iâ€™ve now added the <code class="highlighter-rouge">perform()</code> function in the <code class="highlighter-rouge">form_data_post</code> itself so that I wonâ€™t need to interact with the former.</li>
  <li>I had set the <a href="https://bitbucket.org/me_ydv_5/octave/src/59d3d9c4af257ca141e60420e9ba3c8ab32af0af/liboctave/util/url-transfer.cc#lines-671"><code class="highlighter-rouge">Content-Length</code></a> parameter to get from the length of POSTFIELDS, which isnâ€™t needed as of now.</li>
</ul>

<p>Nevertheless, Iâ€™m pumped up again for furthering my work!</p>

<hr />

<p>There has been some problem in completing the <code class="highlighter-rouge">upload_to_wiki</code> script. Unfortunately, Iâ€™m unable to send the images on to the servers. Other than that, everything is working fine. Iâ€™ve been trying to do the same since the past week, but still no success, even after tracking down the cURLâ€™s source code.</p>

<p>Basically we need to have a linked list of pointers to the information that we want to send as a form data. I tried to traverse that (It is native to cURL and unseen for the end user). Everything looks fine there. The only bottleneck that I can observe for now is, the <a href="https://bitbucket.org/me_ydv_5/octave/src/59d3d9c4af257ca141e60420e9ba3c8ab32af0af/liboctave/util/url-transfer.cc#lines-710"><code class="highlighter-rouge">form_data_post</code></a> function is not working as desired. Iâ€™ve tried all other alternatives to check where my code is not responding as per standards. But I think only the above function must have problem.</p>

<p>I also discussed this issue with the mentors and other people at IRC channel. However, thereâ€™s one more thing to it. The functionality that Iâ€™m currently using (<a href="https://curl.haxx.se/libcurl/c/CURLOPT_HTTPPOST.html">CURLOPT_HTTPPOST</a>) is deprecated now from cURL version 7.56 and instead MIME API is being used. (See <a href="https://github.com/curl/curl/pull/1839">this</a> for more.) I asked Kai about this and he too agreed on the fact that I shuold be keeping backwards compatibilty, but then jwe and andy suggested me to use the latter funcitonality with MIME api and then make the feature available only to those who have cURL 7.56+. Iâ€™ll ask the mentor once again if either the problem gets solved for now and then I change it to MIME API once the work gets over, or I should instead do it now only.</p>

<p>Other than that, I will start implementing the RESTful services from now on, the other half part of the project. So, weâ€™ll see how much of these functions that Iâ€™ve implemented so far get reused.</p>

<p>Until then! :-)</p>

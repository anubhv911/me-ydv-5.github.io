I"<p>Iâ€™ve been selected as a <a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com">Google Summer of Code</a> , 2018 student developer at <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/">GNU Octave</a>. GNU Octave is a high-level language, primarily intended for numerical computations. It provides a convenient command line interface for solving linear and nonlinear problems numerically, and for performing other numerical experiments using a language that is mostly compatible with Matlab. It may also be used as a batch-oriented language.</p>

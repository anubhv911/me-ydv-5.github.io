I" <p>Hi! Now that my exams are over, I am back on the track. First evaluation will take place this week. I will continue my work from the last task, i.e, <code class="highlighter-rouge">wiki_login.m</code>, to complete its implementation and then use it in <code class="highlighter-rouge">publish_to_wiki</code> function that will help us upload the wiki to userâ€™s online wiki. After that I plant to implement the RESTful services part of the project, which has <code class="highlighter-rouge">weboptions</code> function lined up at first.</p>

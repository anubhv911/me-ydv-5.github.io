I"µ<p>With the last week of GSoC arriving, Iâ€™m also in a position to wrap up the project. This week Iâ€™m focusing on thorough testing, documentation and other code optimizations. Iâ€™ve already refactored the existing code of third evaluations a bit in two different drives. In those, Iâ€™ve made the same internal function for setting up various cURL options for webread and webwrite functions. Also Iâ€™ve reduced a significant lines of code as well in some files, because I believe writing quality and useful code is better than writing quantity and useless code, as was suggested by Kai as well in early days of the project.</p>

<p>Iâ€™ve also implemented <a href="https://bitbucket.org/me_ydv_5/octave/commits/026e8e95e076a63fe37706eae19e0b60648545f5#chg-scripts/miscellaneous/webread.m">webread</a> function the previous week.</p>

I"y<p>With the last week of GSoC arriving, I’m also in a position to wrap up the project. This week I’m focusing on thorough testing, documentation and other code optimizations. I’ve already refactored the existing code of third evaluations a bit in two different drives. In those, I’ve made the same internal function for setting up various cURL options for webread and webwrite functions. Also I’ve reduced a significant lines of code as well in some files, because I believe writing quality and useful code is better than writing quantity and useless code, as was suggested by Kai as well in early days of the project.</p>

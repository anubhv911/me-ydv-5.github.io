I"<p>Iâ€™ve implemented the <a href="https://bitbucket.org/me_ydv_5/octave/src/ocs/scripts/miscellaneous/weboptions.m"><code class="highlighter-rouge">weboptions</code></a> function. I also added relevant comments wherever needed, including the code of first evaluation. This completes the second phase evaluation task, i.e, implementing <code class="highlighter-rouge">wiki_upload</code> script and <code class="highlighter-rouge">weboptions</code>. There was an unprecendented delay of a week when I was trying to upload the images on the server. It wouldâ€™ve given me a head start if I had completed the task without the delay, although I am still on the track. Thereâ€™s one thing left, the help text that I wrote for <code class="highlighter-rouge">weboptions</code> isnâ€™t being displayed when I issue <code class="highlighter-rouge">help weboptions</code> because itâ€™s a <code class="highlighter-rouge">Classdef</code> and not <code class="highlighter-rouge">function</code>. Other than this, I feel the task has been executed correctly.</p>

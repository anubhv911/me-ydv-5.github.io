I"2<p>Continuing further, I added more options in <code class="highlighter-rouge">libcurl_wrapper.cc</code>. As described in earlier posts, the current implementation of <code class="highlighter-rouge">wiki_login.m</code> has the JAVA’s interface to Octave in use and I need to replace it with Octave’s own implementation. So, I’ve taken two steps in this direction. Now a user is able to retrieve token when he executes <code class="highlighter-rouge">wiki_login</code> AND use the cookies that are set in a temporary <code class="highlighter-rouge">.txt</code> file to login into the <code class="highlighter-rouge">api.php</code> wiki. Currently, there’s a problem in logging in, because the following cookies are unable to get added, <code class="highlighter-rouge">octave_org_session</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">octave_orgUserID</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">octave_orgUserName</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">octave_orgToken</code>. I got to know about these cookies when I tried to execute the curl-cli commands for logging in.</p>

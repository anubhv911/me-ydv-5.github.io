Hi Stranger! Glad that you came here.
I'm Sahil, a fourth (senior) year undergraduate majoring in Computer Science at IIT Mandi, Himachal Pradesh.

I love music. I primarily listen to Eminem, Divine, Sia, Imagine Dragons and Linkin Park. Hit me up if you have some good music recommendations! I'd love to hear your taste.

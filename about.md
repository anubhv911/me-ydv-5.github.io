Hi Stranger! Glad that you came here.
I'm Sahil, a fourth (senior) year undergraduate majoring in Computer Science at IIT Mandi, Himachal Pradesh.

I strive to not get carried away by others and their picture of me. I love music. I primarily listen to Eminem, Divine, Sia, Imagine Dragons, Linkin Park. I also like Punjabi music.

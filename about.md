Hi Stranger! Glad that you came here. I like dark comedy more than dark chocolate and
sleeping more than anything. Of course, you want to waste your time if you want to read further.


If you've ever wondered why **batterylow**, then that has roots back to my second semester time
when I used to play Call of Duty with friends and had **batterylow** as my alias in the game.
One day while I was playing, my mobile phone popped up `Battery low`, which it used to do, more frequently than the frequency of violet color in the VIBGYOR spectrum and so I named myself the same.

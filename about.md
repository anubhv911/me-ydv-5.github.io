Hi Stranger! Glad that you came here. I like dark comedy more than dark chocolate and
sleeping more than anything.

I'm Sahil, a third (junior) year undergraduate majoring in Computer Science at IIT Mandi, Himachal Pradesh.

If you've ever wondered why **batterylow**, then that has roots back to my second semester time
when I used to play Call of Duty with friends and had **batterylow** as my alias in the game.
One day while I was playing, my mobile phone popped up `Battery low`, which it used to do, more frequently than the frequency of violet color in the VIBGYOR spectrum and so I named myself the same.
